## 🚀 Getting Started

### Step 1: Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need:

1. **Cryptocurrency Wallet**
   - [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) (recommended)
   - [Coinbase Wallet](https://wallet.coinbase.com/)
   - Any wallet that supports WalletConnect

2. **Cryptocurrency for Fees**
   - ETH (for Ethereum network)
   - BNB (for BSC network)
   - XSC (for XSC network)
   - Amount needed: $10-50 depending on network and features

3. **Basic Understanding**
   - What an ERC20 token is
   - How blockchain transactions work
   - Basic wallet operations

### Step 2: Accessing the Application

1. Visit the Token Factory application: `https://your-domain.com`
2. The application will automatically detect your wallet
3. Make sure your wallet is unlocked and ready to use

## 💻 Creating Your First Token

### Step 1: Connect Your Wallet

1. **Click "Connect Wallet"** in the top-right corner
2. **Select your wallet** from the list (MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, etc.)
3. **Approve the connection** in your wallet popup
4. **Verify connection** - you should see your address displayed

![Wallet Connection](./assets/wallet-connect.png)

*🔍 Troubleshooting: If connection fails, refresh the page and try again*

### Step 2: Choose Your Network

1. **Click the network selector** (shows current network)
2. **Select your preferred network**:
   - **Ethereum**: Most popular, higher fees
   - **BSC**: Lower fees, fast transactions
   - **XSC**: Optimized for performance
3. **Approve network switch** in your wallet
4. **Wait for confirmation** - network should update in the interface

![Network Selection](./assets/network-select.png)

### Step 3: Configure Token Basics

1. **Navigate to "Create Token"** page
2. **Fill in basic information**:

   **Token Name** (e.g., "My Awesome Token")
   - Maximum 50 characters
   - Will appear in wallets and explorers
   - Can include spaces and special characters

   **Token Symbol** (e.g., "MAT")
   - Maximum 10 characters
   - Usually 3-5 uppercase letters
   - Must be unique (we'll check for you)

   **Total Supply** (e.g., "1000000")
   - How many tokens to create initially
   - Enter the number without decimals
   - Can't be changed later unless mintable

   **Decimals** (typically 18)
   - How many decimal places your token supports
   - 18 is standard (like ETH)
   - Higher = more precision

3. **Set Initial Owner**
   - Usually your wallet address (pre-filled)
   - This address will control the token
   - Can be changed later by the owner

![Basic Configuration](./assets/basic-config.png)

2. **Select your token**
3. **Click "Mint Tokens"**
4. **Enter amount** and **recipient address**
5. **Approve transaction**

```
⚠️ Important: Only the token owner can mint tokens
```

#### For Pausable Tokens

1. **Go to token management** page
2. **Click "Pause Transfers"** (or "Unpause")
3. **Confirm action** in wallet
4. **All transfers will be stopped** until unpaused

```

4. **Confirm transaction**

```
⚠️ Warning: This action is irreversible. The new owner will have full control.
```

## 🌐 Multi-Chain Deployment

### Deploying to Multiple Networks

1. **Create token on first network** (e.g., Ethereum)
2. **Go to "Deploy to Other Networks"**
3. **Select additional networks** (BSC, XSC)
4. **Review total costs** for all networks
5. **Approve deployments** one by one
6. **Monitor progress** in dashboard

### Managing Cross-Chain Tokens

- **Each network** has a separate token contract
- **Token addresses** will be different on each network
- **Supplies** are independent (not connected)
- **Management** must be done on each network separately

- Invalid configuration

**Solutions**:
1. Increase gas limit/price
2. Wait and retry later
3. Check all form fields
4. Refresh page and reconnect wallet

#### "Symbol Already Exists" Error

**Solution**:
1. Choose a different symbol
2. Check existing tokens on the network
3. Consider adding numbers or prefix (e.g., "MAT2")

#### Wallet Not Connecting

**Solutions**:
1. Unlock your wallet
2. Refresh the page
3. Clear browser cache
4. Try different browser
5. Update wallet extension

#### Token Not Appearing in Wallet

**Solutions**:
1. Manually add token using contract address
2. Wait a few minutes for indexing
3. Check you're on correct network
4. Verify token address

contract TokenUser {
    IERC20 public myToken;

    constructor(address tokenAddress) {
        myToken = IERC20(tokenAddress);
    }

    function useTokens(uint256 amount) external {

}
```

#### **Web3 Application Integration**
```javascript
// Example: Interacting with your token
const tokenContract = new ethers.Contract(
    tokenAddress,
    tokenABI,
    signer
);

const balance = await tokenContract.balanceOf(userAddress);

// Transfer tokens
const tx = await tokenContract.transfer(
    recipientAddress,
    ethers.parseEther("100")
);
```

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: How much does it cost to create a token?**
A: Costs vary by network. Ethereum: $15-80, BSC: $0.50-2, XSC: $0.20-1, plus a small service fee.

**Q: Can I change my token after creation?**
A: Basic properties (name, symbol, total supply) cannot be changed. Advanced features depend on what you enabled during creation.

**Q: Is my token secure?**
A: Yes, our contracts are audited and use industry-standard security practices. However, you're responsible for managing your private keys securely.

**Q: Can I create multiple tokens?**
A: Yes, there's no limit to how many tokens you can create.

### Technical Questions

**Q: What networks are supported?**
A: Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain (BSC), and XSC Network, with more coming soon.

**Q: Can I deploy the same token to multiple networks?**
A: Yes, you can deploy the same configuration to multiple networks, but each will be a separate contract.

**Q: How do I add my token to exchanges?**
A: You'll need to apply to each exchange separately. Start with decentralized exchanges (DEXs) which typically have easier listing processes.
