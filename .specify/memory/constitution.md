# Token Factory Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality First
Code MUST be maintainable, readable, and testable. Every implementation MUST follow SOLID principles, use descriptive naming, and maintain clear separation of concerns. Code reviews are mandatory before merging. No code ships without proper documentation and adherence to project conventions.

### II. Test-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
TDD is mandatory for all features. Tests MUST be written before implementation, fail initially, then pass after correct implementation. Minimum 90% code coverage required. All tests must be automated and run in CI/CD pipeline. No feature is complete without comprehensive unit, integration, and contract tests.

### III. User Experience Consistency
All user interfaces MUST maintain consistent design patterns, interaction behaviors, and accessibility standards. WCAG 2.1 AA compliance is mandatory. Error messages must be helpful and actionable. Loading states and feedback must be immediate and informative. All UI components must work across target platforms and devices.

### IV. Performance Standards
All features MUST meet measurable performance targets: API responses <200ms p95, UI interactions <100ms, page loads <2s on 3G connection. Memory usage must be monitored and optimized. Database queries must be analyzed and indexed appropriately. Performance regression tests are required for all critical paths.

### V. Observability & Monitoring
All systems MUST be observable through structured logging, metrics, and tracing. Error tracking and alerting must be implemented for production systems. Performance monitoring must be continuous with automated alerts for threshold violations. All debugging information must be easily accessible to development teams.

## Performance Standards

System performance MUST meet these non-negotiable targets:
- **API Response Time**: 95th percentile <200ms for all endpoints
- **UI Responsiveness**: All interactions respond within 100ms
- **Page Load Speed**: Complete page render <2 seconds on 3G
- **Memory Usage**: <100MB baseline, <500MB peak for client applications
- **Database Performance**: Query execution <50ms average, <200ms p95
- **Error Rate**: <0.1% for critical user flows, <1% for non-critical features

Performance must be validated through automated testing and continuous monitoring. Any performance regression triggers immediate investigation and resolution.

## Development Workflow

### Quality Gates
All code changes MUST pass these sequential gates:
1. **Local Testing**: All tests pass, linting clean, performance benchmarks met
2. **Code Review**: Peer review for code quality, security, and architectural alignment
3. **Automated Testing**: Full test suite passes in CI environment
4. **Performance Validation**: Performance benchmarks within acceptable thresholds
5. **Security Scan**: Automated security vulnerability detection passes
6. **Integration Testing**: End-to-end user scenarios validate successfully

### Review Requirements
- **Code Reviews**: Mandatory for all changes, minimum 2 approvals for core systems
- **Security Reviews**: Required for authentication, authorization, data handling changes
- **Performance Reviews**: Required for database changes, API modifications, UI components
- **UX Reviews**: Required for user-facing changes, accessibility impact assessment

### Deployment Standards
- **Feature Flags**: All new features must be behind feature toggles for safe rollback
- **Rollback Plan**: Every deployment must have documented rollback procedures
- **Health Checks**: Automated health monitoring with alerting for failures
- **Blue-Green Deployment**: Zero-downtime deployments for production systems

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices and standards. All pull requests and code reviews MUST verify constitutional compliance. Any violation must be justified with technical rationale and approved by senior developers.

**Amendment Process**: Constitutional amendments require documentation of impact, approval from development team leads, and migration plan for existing code. All changes must maintain backward compatibility with existing workflows.

**Compliance Review**: Weekly constitution compliance audits are mandatory. Violations are tracked and must be resolved within one sprint cycle. Persistent violations trigger architectural review and potential refactoring.

**Enforcement**: Development tooling must enforce constitutional requirements through automated linting, testing, and quality gates. Manual processes must include constitutional compliance checklists.
