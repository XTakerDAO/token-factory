**Created**: 2025-09-26
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "创建一个自动创建代币的dapp，基于自定义的EVM链，提供一些参数供配置，然后可以调用钱包在链上创建ERC20，支持高级功能(铸造/销毁/暂停)，通过一个合约来发行这些代币，实现为代理合约便于后期增加新功能"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A crypto user wants to create their own ERC20 token with custom features on one of the supported blockchain networks. They visit the DApp, select their preferred network (ETH, BSC, or XSC), configure basic token parameters (name, symbol, supply, decimals), choose desired advanced features (mintable, burnable, pausable), set up permissions and ownership, review service fees and gas costs, connect their wallet, confirm payment, and deploy the complete ERC20 token contract through the factory system.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** user visits the DApp homepage, **When** they select a blockchain network (ETH/BSC/XSC), **Then** the interface shows network-specific information and fee structure
2. **Given** user has selected a network, **When** they fill in basic token parameters (name, symbol, supply, decimals), **Then** the form validates inputs and enables advanced feature selection
3. **Given** basic parameters are valid, **When** user selects advanced features (mintable, burnable, pausable), **Then** system shows feature descriptions and permission settings
4. **Given** features are configured, **When** user sets ownership and permission roles, **Then** system displays feature preview with enabled capabilities
5. **Given** all configurations are complete, **When** user clicks "Create Token", **Then** service fee breakdown and feature summary are displayed with wallet connection prompt
6. **Given** wallet is connected and all confirmations made, **When** user approves the transaction, **Then** factory contract deploys the complete ERC20 token and user receives confirmation with contract address
7. **Given** token creation is successful, **When** user views their token details, **Then** they see all configured parameters, enabled features, and can access the token on the blockchain explorer

### Edge Cases
- What happens when user enters invalid token parameters (empty name, zero supply, invalid symbols)?
- How does system handle wallet connection failures or rejections?
- What occurs when blockchain transaction fails due to insufficient gas or network issues?
- How does the DApp behave when user switches to unsupported network in their wallet?
- What happens when user selects XSC network but their wallet doesn't have XSC network configured?
- How does system respond when user has insufficient funds for service fees or gas fees?
- What occurs when XSC network compatibility check fails due to EVM version mismatch?
- How does system handle network switching during the token creation process?
- What happens when user selects conflicting advanced features (e.g., max supply with mintable)?
- How does system handle permission configuration errors or invalid owner addresses?
- What occurs when factory contract deployment fails or contract verification fails?
- How does system respond when advanced features are not supported on selected network?
- What happens when user tries to deploy identical token parameters that already exist?
